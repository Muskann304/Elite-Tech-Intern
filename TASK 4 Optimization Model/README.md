# 📈 Product Mix Optimization

This project solves a product mix optimization problem using linear programming in Python with PuLP.

## 🧠 Problem Description

A factory produces two products (A and B) with constraints on machine and labor hours. The goal is to determine how many units of each product to produce to maximize profit.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python product_mix_optimization.py
```

## 📊 Output

- Optimal number of units to produce
- Maximum profit
- Visualized feasible region and optimal point
